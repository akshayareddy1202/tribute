        <h2>Potti Sriramulu</h2>
        <p>
            Potti Sriramulu (16 March 1901 â€“ 15 December 1952) was an Indian freedom fighter and revolutionary who played a significant role in achieving the linguistic reorganization of states in India. His self-sacrifice through a hunger strike led to the formation of the state of Andhra Pradesh, which was carved out for Telugu-speaking people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sriramulu's dedication to the cause of linguistic and cultural identity inspired millions and highlighted the importance of recognizing regional languages and cultures in a diverse country like India. His life and work continue to be celebrated for their impact on Indian federalism and unity.
        </p>
        <h2>Tribute</h2>
        <p>
            "The sacrifice of Potti Sriramulu reminds us of the power of determination and selflessness. His unwavering commitment to justice and equality for Telugu-speaking people created a ripple effect that shaped modern India. Let us honor his legacy by promoting unity and respect for cultural diversity."
